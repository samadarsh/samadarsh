🔭 Currently going deeper into Generative AI, LLM internals, and production-ready ML systems.  
📊 With a trading background (Equity & F&O), I naturally think in probabilities, risk, and structured decision-making.  
🌱 Exploring transformers, RAG pipelines, evaluation strategies, and deployment workflows.  
⚙️ Focused on building practical, end-to-end systems — not just running experiments.  
📈 Particularly interested in applying AI to finance, analytics, and intelligent automation.
